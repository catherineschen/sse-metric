# Evaluating Search System Explainability with Psychometrics and Crowdsourcing

By Catherine Chen and Carsten Eickhoff

This code corresponds to the paper: __Evaluating Search System Explainability with Psychometrics and Crowdsourcing__, in _Proceedings of the 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR ’24)_, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA.

The code in this repo utilizes factor_analyzer and semopy Python packages to conduct Structural Equation Modeling. For result reproducibility, we provide the data collected via crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific. The dataset has been anonymized and any unique identifiers have been removed.
